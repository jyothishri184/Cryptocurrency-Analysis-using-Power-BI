## Project Overview
üìçThis is my first project on the field of Data Analysis using Power BI, representing the beginning of my journey into the fascinating world of data analysis.

Cryptocurrency, a digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority. With thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence, choosing the right investment can be challenging. Many individuals have faced losses due to inadequate information and improper decision-making. This tool aims to empower users with data-driven insights to enhance decision-making processes in cryptocurrency investments.
